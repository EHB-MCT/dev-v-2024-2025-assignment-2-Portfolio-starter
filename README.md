- `PUT /api/strava` - Update an existing activity
- `DELETE /api/strava` - Delete an activity

## Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the root directory with the following variables:
```env
MONGODB_PASSWORD=your_mongodb_password
```

## Database Configuration

The application uses MongoDB Atlas as its database. To configure:

1. Create a MongoDB Atlas account
2. Create a new cluster
3. Add your IP address to the IP whitelist
4. Create a database user
5. Update the `.env` file with your database password

## Development

To contribute to the project:

1. Fork the repository
2. Create a feature branch
```bash
git checkout -b feature/my-new-feature
```
3. Commit your changes
```bash

```
4. Push to the branch
```bash
git push origin feature/my-new-feature
```
5. Create a Pull Request
