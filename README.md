# Unity Project Starter
## Project Overview
This is a starter setup for Unity projects. The folder structure is pre-organized for assets, scripts,
and scenes, allowing for smooth project development.
## How to Run

2. Open the `Scenes/Main.unity` scene and press "Play" to start the game.
## Folder Structure
- `Assets/`: All assets such as prefabs, scripts, models, and UI elements.
- `Scenes/`: Contains Unity scene files.
- `Scripts/`: Game logic scripts.
- `Art/`: Contains textures and models used for the game.
- `Plugins/`: For external libraries or assets.
