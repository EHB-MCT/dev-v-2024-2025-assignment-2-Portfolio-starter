# C# Coding Conventions
## Naming Conventions
- **Variables:** Use `camelCase` (e.g., `playerHealth`).
- **Constants:** Use `UPPERCASE_SNAKE_CASE` (e.g., `MAX_JUMP_HEIGHT`).
- **Functions:** Use `PascalCase` (e.g., `MovePlayer()`).
- **Classes:** Use `PascalCase` (e.g., `PlayerController`).
## Indentation
- Use **4 spaces** for indentation.
## Line Length
- Limit lines to **100 characters** for better readability.
## Comments
- Use `//` for single-line comments and `///` for XML doc comments for method documentation.
## File Structure
- Place each class in its own file, matching the filename to the class name (e.g.,
`PlayerController.cs`).
